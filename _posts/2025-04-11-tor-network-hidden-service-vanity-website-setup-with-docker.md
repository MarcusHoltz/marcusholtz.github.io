# Using Tor script to create a Tor network hidden service with vanity .onion address and export a service to the internet

## Tor is not hidden

"In our experiments we collected 173667 unique .onion addresses in all using a single Amazon EC2 instances in 1 hour and found 4857 hidden web services online."

- [Out-of-band discovery and evaluation for tor hidden services](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2851613.2851798){:target="_blank"}

- [Tor: Hidden Service Intelligence Extraction](https://rp.os3.nl/2017-2018/p98/report.pdf){:target="_blank"}


### Hidden Service Discovery

If you were to create a brand-new Tor v3 address, its address is not inherently public, but you might have little time before you're discovered:

- Bots & Crawlers: Hours to a day. Automated services scanning .onion addresses might identify the service pretty quickly.

- Public Discovery (like human users or public listings): Days to weeks, depending on whether the address is actively shared or found.

This is just an estimate, and the actual time can vary based on scanning frequency, network traffic, and how indexed your .onion address becomes.



## Tor to host an .onion service

Now, with the warnings in place, we can begin.

The purpose of this repo/post is to give someone a chance to test out hosting an .onion hidden service.

You can use this to quickly share a service to a friend, client, or even your future self.

> A Tor hidden service does not need your server to have open ports or port forwarding - because it does not accept direct inbound connections from the public internet. Instead, both the client and the hidden service connect outbound to the Tor network, establishing circuits to special relays called introduction and rendezvous points. All communication is routed through these Tor relays, so as long as your server can make outbound connections to the Tor network, it can host a hidden service!

## 1-up-tor-onion-address script

[The 1-up-tor-onion-address.sh script](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) sets up **one** service that will be available through a [Tor .onion address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion).

> This service is only available through the Tor network

This is intended as a demonstration. I hope you're able to learn and enjoy using.

* * *

### Script Requirements

The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script will need `sudo`. 

Sudo is required to set all of the directory permissions correctly. 

You will then need docker installed to generate a vanity address and run the `docker-compose.yml` file that starts up Tor.

The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script is only intended to prepare the environment we're using with Docker.




* * *

### Changes the Script makes

The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script sets up two directories, a file, and optionally a vanity address.



#### Two Directories

You need sudo privs for:

- tor_config/vanity_keys/

and

- tor_data/

> Those directories store the keys that are used for your .onion address. Kept safe from any normal user.



#### A file: torrc

A [torrc file](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/torrc/){:target="_blank"} contains all the settings Tor uses. 

You need sudo privs for:

- tor_config/torrc

> By changing this file we can tell Tor what services we want to serve on a Tor Hidden Service and where to find the corresponding .onion address.


* * *

## Vanity Name Creation

A [vanity address](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/vanity-addresses/){:target="_blank"} is an onion address that starts with a pre-chosen number of characters, usually a meaningful name related to a specific Onion Service. 

For instance, one might try to generate an onion address for the mysitename website and end up with something looking like this:

`mysitenameyx4fi3l6x2gyzmtmgxjyqyorj9qsb5r543izcwymle.onion`

This has some advantages:

- It is easy for Onion Services users to know which site they are about to access.

- It has some branding appeal to site owners.

- It is easy for Onion Services operators to debug their logs and know which services have errors.

- Anyone else is very unlikely to come up with the exact key from the example above, but they may be able to find a similar key - one beginng with the same few letters. 

  - The longer the vanity name length, the less likly it is to have a forgery made.


* * *

### Vanity Name Length

You can only pick something, at max, 7 characters.

> Why?

Let's say you were running this on a Raspberry Pi 2B....

Take a look at the approximate generation time per character for a Raspberry Pi 2B below:

#### Approximate Generation Time per Character Count Chart

1  : <1 second
2  : <1 second
3  : 1 second
4  : 30 seconds
5  : 16 minutes
6  : 8.5 hours
7  : 11.5 days
8  : 1 year
9  : 32 years
10 : 1,024 years
11 : 32,768 years
12 : 1 million years

### How is the vanity generated

Thanks to the work on the [cathugger/mkp224o](https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o){:target="_blank"} repository, we're able to generate vanity address for tor onion v3 (ed25519) hidden services.

- Specifically, the [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script will run: `docker run ghcr.io/cathugger/mkp224o:master -n 3 <your_vanity_name>`

- It will generate `3` .onion addresses that begin with your vanity name, allowing you to select a favorite.

- The .onion address will be in `tor_config/vanity_keys/`


### Can't I just use my own .onion address

Yes! The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script will prompt you to use your own, you just have to provide the path.


#### Instructions for Using Bringing Your Own Vanity Tor Address:

1. Make sure you have all of your files for your .onion address in the same directory:

   - `hostname` - Contains your .onion address

   - `hs_ed25519_secret_key` - Your private key

   - `hs_ed25519_public_key` - Your public key


2. After the [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script completes, verify your hidden service is correct:

```bash

sudo cat tor_data/hidden_service/hostname

```


* * *

## What Service to put on Tor

You will also need a service to provide to the .onion address. 

This can be anything. It can be another docker container, a python web server on your laptop, your favorite IoT device, whatever!

You will just need to give The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script:

- The `IP` or `Hostname` of the service you're sending to the Tor network.

- The `Port` for the service to forward over the .onion address.

- ONLY ONE SERVICE!!!    --> tor_data/hidden_service/

> This script is designed for demonstration and as such, there's only one service designed into the script. You can always make multiple services on the same .onion address with different ports, or a new .onion address for every service. But today, only one service.


* * *

### Sample Service

If you really dont have anything to use as a service, you can create a quick HTTP server with bash:

- Creates an HTTP server using `netcat`

- Server will respond on `port 5432`

- Exit the netcat command with: `ctrl + c`

```bash

echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<p>Works for me</p><p>$(date)</p>" | nc -l -p 5432

```

> Add an `&` on the end to the command - to let it run in the background.

> Exit from the background with: `kill $(ps -ef | grep [5]432 | awk '{print $2}')`


* * *

## Torrc is important

The `torrc` file lets you define `HiddenServiceDir` and `HiddenServicePort` directives, these tell Tor where to store your service you're sending to the Tor network's keys and what ports to forward, making your .onion site accessible.


* * *

## The 1-up-tor-onion-address.sh script uses two directories

File permissions are critical for Tor hidden services:
   - Directories need 700 permissions (drwx------)
   - Key files need 600 permissions (-rw-------)
   - The docker container will adjusts these permissions for you

The Tor user (not root) must own all these files inside the container


* * *

## Browsers that find an onion service

- Use [Brave Browser](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018121491-What-is-a-Private-Window-with-Tor-Connectivity){:target="_blank"}

- Use [Tor Browser](https://support.torproject.org/){:target="_blank"}

## Uninstall

How do you stop the Tor network now that you've let it onto your computer? You've let Skynet spread!!! 

1. Go get a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) container. HDPE is a commonly used plastic for robust, leak-proof containers.

2. Fill this up to the brim with high octane gasoline.

3. Dowse your computer in as much gas as possible.

4. Now your computer will run faster, but the Tor network is still on it.

5. Should we: 
 
 - uninstall the work we did
 
 - kill Tor with fire

6. To uninstall, delete the directory (tor-hidden-service-main) you created for this demonstration (you may have to use sudo) and run the following to remove the docker container:

   ```bash
   
   docker stop $(docker ps -a | grep tor-hidden-service | awk '{print $1}') 2>/dev/null && docker rm $(docker ps -a | grep tor-hidden-service | awk '{print $1}') 2>/dev/null
   
   ```


* * *

## Additional Ways to Use: Tor on OPNSense

OPNsense has [a great tor plugin](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/tor.html){:target="_blank"}, `os-tor`, that can do tor SOCKS proxy, hidden services, and authentication as well but with the OPNsense GUI and Terminal.

You can use it as a proxy for your browsers or setup a hidden onion service here as well, just using the GUI.

But, to get the authentication part working... we need to enter the terminal.


* * *

### Tor Hidden Onion Service with Secret Authentication

#### Crypto Passwords

Because, let's be honest - if you can send someone the long string that is an onion address, you could probably give them the private key for that service as well.

Tor browser is such a sweetheart that when you paste in the onion address, it'll immediatly ask you for the private key as well. 


* * *

### Onion Service Authorized clients

If you followed [the official documentation for OPNSense, os-tor](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/tor.html){:target="_blank"} above, you will have seen the Onion Service creation, and, possibly the Authorized clients section.

You can enter as many clients as you want, but nothing will happen. You still need to add the appropreate file for the client in the terminal.

Let's go do that now.



* * *

### Console in to a terminal

1. SSH, open a console, login with a keyboard, whatever. You need to be looking at a terminal to add files.

2. Navigate to: `/var/db/tor/<name-of-service>/authorized_clients/`

3. We will make the `<authorized_client_name_you_picked_in_Onion_Service_above>.auth` file required for this to work. But first,

4. Run [the script below](#script). Then you will have two keys, a public and a private key.

5. You need to take the public key

6. Make the .auth file referenced above.

7. Paste in: `descriptor:x25519:`

8. and paste after, `descriptor:x25519:`, your public key from step 5.

9. Save your .auth file

10. Make sure it is in your `/var/db/tor/<name-of-service>/authorized_clients/`

11. [Cue up victory hype soundtrack](https://smashcustommusic.net/song/5403){:target="_blank"}, and [play along](https://musescore.com/user/10564571/scores/6818645){:target="_blank"}.



* * *

### Using the private key to access services

The onion address you can find under `Services > Tor > Information` and that's how you can access the `Onion Service Routing` you set when you read [the official documentation for OPNSense, os-tor](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/tor.html){:target="_blank"}, again that address will only let someone with the private key access it.

There is no username you need to enter. That's mainly for organizational purposes. Just **enter** `the private key` when prompted and you should see the onion service.


* * *

### A Differernt Tor Proxy supplying the example below:

OPNSense cannot do client authentication. You can, however, run a different tor proxy that will allow client authentication:

This involves: `.auth_private`

That file is different.

You must put the tor hidden service address first, with the .onion removed.



#### Example

1. Example address: `wisdomhrc3g5en6lcmb7i7jte6nj5rc33ctzgfiq5lozhqo2uoaccvqd.onion`

2. Will become: `wisdomhrc3g5en6lcmb7i7jte6nj5rc33ctzgfiq5lozhqo2uoaccvqd`

3. Now that you have the tor hidden service you want to use in the file, you must include the descriptor and the private key.

4. The private key should come after, `wisdomhrc3g5en6lcmb7i7jte6nj5rc33ctzgfiq5lozhqo2uoaccvqd:descriptor:x25519:`

5 Save your .auth_private with the key on the end

6. Copy it to your `/var/lib/tor/onion_auth/`

## Script

### FreeBSD-compatible X25519 key generator with built-in Base32 encoder

Sorry. I found it a big pain to try and generate these auth keys in FreeBSD, because they dont include base32 in packages.

This script takes care of:

- X25519 key generation:  private.key  &  public.key

- Base32 encodes these keys to make them Tor compatible

```bash
