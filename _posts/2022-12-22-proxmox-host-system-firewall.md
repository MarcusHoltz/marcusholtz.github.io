# Proxmox Networking Security


## Firewall

Install UFW & Fail2Ban:

`sudo apt install ufw fail2ban`

:NOTE: Be sure you have installed ifupdown2 before here, or it may brake the connection.

* * * 

In a basic firewall, denying all incoming traffic and allowing outgoing traffic is a good place to start:

`ufw default deny incoming`

`ufw default allow outgoing`



Next, you want to open up any services you wish to be available to the internet:

`sudo ufw allow 47979/tcp comment 'tcp port 47979 for SSH'`

`sudo ufw allow 38365/udp comment 'udp port 38365 for OpenVPN'`

`sudo ufw allow 8006/tcp  comment 'tcp port 8006 over HTTPS for Proxmox'`

`sudo ufw enable`

`sudo ufw status numbered`

`sudo systemctl enable ufw`

Verify with: 

`lsof -i`

* * *

This is just the start. You will need to open many more ports used by Proxmox:

See the [Proxmox VE Administration Guide -- Ports used by Proxmox VE](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#_ports_used_by_proxmox_ve)

* * *


### Problems with the Firewall? 

Disable:

`ufw disable`


Wipe:

`ufw reset`


* * *

### What's going on now that there's a wall up?

To see what services are running behind the firewall on local ports:

`sudo ss`

`sudo ss -anpt`

-s all sockets (listening & connected)

-n shows port numbers (not just service names)

-p process

-t tcp sockets (HTTPS/SSH)


`sudo nmap -sS <public ip address>`







## Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban's config resides in : `/etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf` BUT

Place your config inside of `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` it takes precedence.


### Fail2Ban config

Add the following:

```
echo "# UFW is our Firewall. By default, it will use iptables to ban IPs ">>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local
echo "[DEFAULT]">>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local
echo "banaction = ufw">>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local
echo -n "ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ">>/etc/fail2ban/jail.local

#### openvpn.conf, proxmox.conf were created inside of /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/

Fire up fail2ban:

`systemctl start fail2ban`

`sudo systemctl enable fail2ban`

`sudo systemctl restart fail2ban`

### Fail2Ban Recovery

Lockout Recovery:

In the event that you find yourself locked out of your server due to fail2ban, you can still gain access. To do this, enter the following command:

`iptables -n -L`

Look for your IP address in the source column of any fail2ban chains. 

To remove your IP address from a jail, you can use the following command, replacing IP and jailname with the IP address and name of the jail that youâ€™d like to unban:


`fail2ban-client set jailname unbanip 192.168.4.5`

or just stop the service `fail2ban-client stop`

##### More Fun Firewall Ideas

Dont even DROP or REJECT packets. Just accept them all. Attackers will have no clue what is actually open and what is not -- unless they manually identify the connections.

Realistically, you could probably get away with accepting the connection for unknown ports, blackholing the data, then closing the connection after a timeout. However, that will cause problems with legitimate users if their application makes a connection to one of these ports.
